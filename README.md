# Image Segmentation for Retail

This code uses the results from the [Product Recognizer API](https://cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/product-recognizer)
to generate new cropped images of products from the original shelf image.

The cropped images are saved in the same bucket than the original shelf image, under the `crop` folder.
